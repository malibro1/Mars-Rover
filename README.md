# Mars-Rover
For this project, Mars Rover, we were tasked with assembling, setting up, and testing the SIUE Mars Rover Kit. 

This Project was for MRE 320 with Dr. Zhang, Spring 2024, at Southern Illinois University - Edwardsville. This was done by group 3 consisting of Aurora Clark, Malina Brown, and Ethan Zumbahlen.
