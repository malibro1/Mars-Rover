Barometer graphs and IMU/GPS graphs were separated to two slides to be more readable.
Task I - Weather Data Results was changed to Task I - Weather Data Collected.
The min Max Mean bars were removed from the Weather Data Collected slide.
Since our group didn't do the DHT-11 measurement extr credit the temperature section on the Weather Data Collected slide was changed to talk about temperature compensation and the group believes it does for the "calibrated" altitude.
The altitude and Pressure sections on the Weather Data Collected slide were worded better.
